# OHMComm
This project started as an IT-Project at the [faculty for Computer Science of the technical university Georg Simon Ohm NÃ¼rnberg](http://www.th-nuernberg.de/seitenbaum/fakultaeten/informatik/page.html) in summer semester 2015 and winter semester 2015/2016 to create a platform-independent voice-over-IP peer-to-peer communication program in C++.

This program is currently developed under linux (Fedora 22) and Windows (7/8) and tested under Mac OS X.

OHMComm is based upon [RtAudio](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/) and therefore supports all audio-libraries supported by RtAudio (see [RtAudio API-Notes](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/apinotes.html)). 
The audio-data are (optionally but highly recommended) encoded with the included [opus-codec](http://www.opus-codec.org/).
As of version 0.8, RtAudio as well as Opus are optional and [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) is also supported as audio-library.

## Build it

#### Under Linux/Mac OS
You will need a compiler with full C++11 support and cmake in version 2.6 or higher.
Additionally you will require the development-header for the supported audio-library of your choice,
for *ALSA* this would be `libasound-dev` on Debian-based systems and `alsa-lib-devel` on Fedora.

	$ cd <project-directory>
	$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ./CMakeLists.txt
	$ make OHMCommLib	# To build the library
	$ make OHMComm		# To build the executable

This will build the library/executable into `<project-directory>/build/` by default.
## Run it

#### Under Linux/Mac OS/Windows

	$ cd <executable-directory>	
	$ ./OHMComm		# To run in interactive mode
	$ ./OHMComm	-h	# Prints all command-line arguments
	$ ./OHMComm path/to/config-file	# Runs in file-configuration mode
